# About Me

## Introduction
Hello there! I'm Marian, a seasoned Quality Assurance (QA) tester with a passion for gaming and software development. With over 6 years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in ensuring top-notch quality and delivering exceptional user experiences. Currently, I am expanding my horizons and delving into the world of iOS development through Angela Yu's comprehensive course. My goal is to not only test applications but also create them from scratch.

## Professional Background
Throughout my career, I have primarily focused on QA testing in the gaming and software sectors. This diverse experience has given me a deep understanding of the intricacies involved in delivering flawless products to end-users. I have been involved in various stages of the software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, test planning, test execution, defect tracking, and reporting. My attention to detail, analytical mindset, and ability to think outside the box have consistently helped me uncover critical issues and enhance the overall quality of products.

## iOS Development Journey
In my quest to broaden my skill set, I have embarked on a journey to learn iOS development. I am currently undertaking Angela Yu's highly regarded course, which provides a comprehensive foundation for building iOS applications. By following this course, I aim to leverage my QA testing expertise to not only identify potential issues but also develop a deeper understanding of how applications are designed and developed.

## QA Projects
Throughout my career, I have worked on numerous projects, contributing to the success of various gaming and software products. Here are some notable highlights:

- **Watch Dogs Legion**: As a QA tester, I played a vital role in the testing phase of Watch Dogs Legion, an immersive open-world action-adventure game. Through rigorous testing, I identified and reported critical bugs, working closely with the development team to ensure a seamless and engaging gaming experience for players.

- **[Obodo](https://obodo.app)**: In my capacity as a QA tester, I made substantial contributions to Obodo, a renting app designed to streamline the rental process. By meticulously testing the app's features and functionalities, I helped uncover and resolve issues, leading to an improved user experience and enhanced satisfaction for renters.

## Current Focus

Currently, my primary focus is on mastering iOS development concepts and techniques. Here are some of the current course project apps and my personal project that I am working on:

- **Clima**: This is a course project where I built a weather app using Core Location. It enables users to get real-time weather updates for their current location and other locations of interest.

- **Flash Chat**: Another course project I am worked on is Flash Chat, which involves integrating CocoaPods, Firebase, and custom cells. This messaging app allows users to communicate in real-time with features such as text messages, image sharing, and user authentication.

- **TrackIt**: Currently, I finished a personal project called TrackIt. It involves integrating custom cells, API calls, and implementing search functionality. TrackIt is designed to help users track their daily activities and set personal goals.

By actively working on these projects, I am gaining hands-on experience in iOS development, exploring various frameworks and technologies, and honing my skills in creating functional and user-friendly applications.
